1. Frontend:
- Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface.
- The application should have an input field to add new tasks, a list to display existing tasks, and
options to edit or delete each task.
- Implement basic validation for the input field (e.g., no empty submissions).
- (Optional) Enhance the UI with a frontend framework/library of your choice (e.g., React, Vue.js).
2. Backend:
- Create a simple REST API to manage tasks with endpoints for creating, fetching, updating, and
deleting tasks.
- Use Node.js with any framework you choose (e.g., Express.js).
- Store tasks in any relational Database (e.g: MySQL)
